#  Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression (Excel)

## Overview

This project uses **Multiple Linear Regression** in **Microsoft Excel** to analyze and predict student performance based on academic and lifestyle factors. The goal is to understand how variables such as prior scores, study hours, sleep patterns, and extracurricular activities affect a student's **Performance Index**.

> All analysis, modeling, and interpretation were done using **Excel's Data Analysis Toolpak**, emphasizing high interpretability and accessibility.

--------

## üìÅ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression)
- Contains both **categorical** and **numerical** variables
- Target Variable: `Performance Index`

-------

##  Key Steps

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Used boxplots and bar charts to explore distributions
- Observed narrow, near-normal distribution of performance index
- Analyzed impact of extracurricular activity on distribution

### 2. **Multicollinearity Check**
- Checked correlation among independent variables
- Confirmed no strong multicollinearity ‚Äî model is stable

### 3. **Model 1 ‚Äì Initial Regression**
- Predictors: Previous Scores, Sleep Hours, Sample Papers Practiced
- Achieved **Adjusted R¬≤ ‚âà 0.84**
- All predictors statistically significant (p < 0.05)

### 4. **Model 2 ‚Äì Improved Regression**
- Added `Hours Studied` and binary-encoded `Extracurricular Activity`
- Achieved **Adjusted R¬≤ ‚âà 0.98**
- Key finding: **Every additional hour studied increases performance index by ~2.85**

### 5. **Final Prediction Formula**
```
Performance Index =
-34.07 + 0.62*Extracurricular_Yes + 2.85*Hours_Studied
+ 1.01*Previous_Scores + 0.48*Sleep_Hours + 0.19*Sample_Papers
```
